# Vite + TailwindCSS (no framework)

`npm start` will...start the `localhost:3000` server.

See the `// TODO` in [`tailwind.config.js`](./tailwind.config.js). 

If you want to load Tailwind from the HTML, you may need to switch this to something like: `content: ["./index.{html,js}"],`. If your Tailwind styles aren't loading, it's probably something here. More ‚ÑπÔ∏è info in the [Tailwind docs](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/content-configuration).

Other than that, there is some opinionated/standard stuff included for ESLint and Prettier.

Hope it helps. Give it a ‚≠ê, will ya? ü§ì
